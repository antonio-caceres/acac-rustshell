# `acacls`

This repository hosts a Rust binary crate providing a wrapper around `gls`
that I use instead of either `ls` or `gls` on some of my machines.

The documentation for the binary itself is in the file src/main.rs.

I currently use an implementation I wrote in `zsh`, but I'm rewriting id
from scratch in Rust as an exercise.
